KDTREE-JK/LATLON is a package for using KD-Trees to search
in latitude and longitude, by putting points on the unit sphere, and searching
in 3d.

==== Functions ======

(build-kdtree-latlon :npoints 10)

   Trivial wrapper to make a 3d KD tree, with a subclassed defstruct.


(insert-latlon kdtree-latlon longitude latitude object
			     &key vec defer)

   Insert longitude,latitude into KD tree.  VEC is an optinal temporary
   vector of length 3 to reduce consing. DEFER is to defer insertion
   until balancing.


(kd-latlon-search-in-angle
    kdtree-latlon longitude latitude angular-distance
    &key vec kdresult sort nearest-point action)

     Search a 3d KDTREE-LATLON around LONGITUDE,LATIDUDE (degrees) and
     return points within ANGULAR-DISTANCE (degrees, along surface of
     unit sphere).  VEC is an optional scratch vector of length 3 of
     type KD-FLOAT.

     As in KDTREE package, KDRESULT is the result structure, sort
     means to sort by distance, NEAREST-POINT means to return only
     single nearest point, and ACTION is to perform action instead of
     search.

     The distance returned in KDRESULT is modified to represent the
     along-surface distance of unit sphere.
